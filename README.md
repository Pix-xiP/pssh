# Pssh

A simple TUI wrapper around ssh that launches a searchable menu of hosts loaded from the .ssh/config file.

It shows the host, alternative names, the port it uses, and the hostname to connect to.

## Installation

You can locally install this with:

```bash
go install github.com/pix-xip/pssh@latest 
```
